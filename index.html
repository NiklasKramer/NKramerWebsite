            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>N KRAMER is the the alias of Berlin-based Niklas Kramer, who also performs under the moniker: Still
                Parade. Where his latest Still Parade record is a Brian Wilson inspired DIY gem that’s full of psych-pop
                songwriting, the N KRAMER project evokes a green world, where synthesised strings and winds evoke still,
                halcyon days and hushed landscapes. A blend of modular synth, soft percussion and subtle tape effects
                that are combined in his delicate way.</p>

                            There is something beautiful and pure about the textures of European Experimental Music in the late 70s. A unique sound palette forming and encapsulating a distinct and exciting world.

                            On his Debut EP, “Endless” Berlin-based musician and producer N KRAMER is picking up on these sounds and takes the listener on a dream-like journey through this delicate musical world.
                            Taking cues from abstract art, different shapes and colours are combined to evoke a sense of emotion. Polyrhythmic patterns that seem to be constantly evolving, reflect the works of ambient pioneers such as Ashra, Harmonia and of course, Brian Eno. A blend of modular synth, soft percussion and subtle tape effects that is put together in a unique and individual style.

                            The EP wades through the feeling of how short-lived experiences can alter your whole perspective. Songs like "Endless" and “It Has Never Worked Before (Timeless)” try to apprehend these feelings and extend them, wrapping the listener in a swelling blanket of comfort.

                            “Endless” will be released March 30 on N KRAMER’s own imprint FEEL FLOWS.
